<---------------------------------------------SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION--------------------------------------------->


Speech Emotion Recognition Using Voice is one of my project in my college days and the 3rd year 
->I used to train the minimum amount of dataset that i have got through the Kaggle. By pushing the data i achieve 75% of accuracy .
->I used the Anaconda Navigator to present the project . If you like to take my project i suggest you to train many dataset and generate more accuracy.


About My Project:
Objective: 
The project aims to develop a system that can identify and classify human emotions based on vocal characteristics.

Project Components

1)Data Collection: 
	Gathering audio samples of individuals expressing various emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger).
2)Feature Extraction: 
	Analyzing audio signals to extract relevant features like pitch, tone, volume, and speech rate.
3)Machine Learning Models: 
	Training algorithms (SVM, neural networks) to recognize patterns in extracted features corresponding to specific emotions.
4)Testing and Validation: 
	Evaluating model performance using a separate dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability.
5)Applications: 
	Potential uses include enhancing human-computer interaction, improving customer service, and aiding in mental health assessments.
